p2gstick-website
========

Here you can find the source for the project's main website and blog (http://p2gstick.org). It is hosted on GitHub pages and uses Jekyll for the blog.

I will probably add some more documentation here in the future but I'm currently more concentrated on making the site itself nice :)
