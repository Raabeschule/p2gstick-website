Hi there again!

I'm sorry we weren't able to post more blog articles in the past but we've been busy working on the project. Tomorrow is the day we need to submit the documentation for Jugend Forscht (a German competition we are participating in). So obviously, we have now reached a stage where we have a first version of our project ready to be shared.

As you might imagine, a first prototype for the p2gstick hardware is ready, as well and that's what this article is all about. We want to share our design with you.
Attached, you will find a photo of our current breadboard version. If you are looking for the schematics, please refer to the GitHub links in the sidebar.

*Note:* We will of course publish the documentation as soon as possible. As of now, it is only available in German but we do most certainly plan to translate it.
